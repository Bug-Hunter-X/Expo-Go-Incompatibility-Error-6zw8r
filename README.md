# Expo Go Incompatibility Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when developing Expo applications and testing with Expo Go. The error arises when the application uses a library or module incompatible with Expo Go's runtime environment.

## The Problem

Expo Go provides a convenient way to test Expo apps without a full build.  However, it has limitations.  If your app uses libraries that require native modules or have specific dependencies not bundled with Expo Go, you'll encounter runtime errors. The errors may be cryptic, indicating a failure to find or load the required module.

## The Solution

The solution depends on the specific library or module causing the issue.

* **Use Expo-compatible alternatives:** Replace incompatible libraries with Expo-compatible alternatives. Expo's documentation and community often offer suitable replacements.
* **Eject from Expo (Not Recommended):** As a last resort, you can eject from Expo.  This gives you full control but sacrifices the benefits of Expo's managed workflow. It's generally recommended to avoid this unless absolutely necessary.
* **Check Library Compatibility:**  Carefully check the library's documentation to verify compatibility with Expo and Expo Go.
* **Update Expo SDK:** Ensure you're using an up-to-date Expo SDK, as newer versions frequently improve compatibility and fix bugs.

## Example

The `bug.js` file demonstrates an application using an hypothetical incompatible library.  The `bugSolution.js` shows how to resolve this by using an Expo-compatible alternative.
