This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a library or module that is not compatible with the Expo Go environment.  The error message might not be very descriptive, but it essentially means the Expo Go runtime can't find or use the required module. For example, it might happen if your app relies on native modules that aren't available in Expo Go, or if there's an incompatibility between the library's version and the Expo Go version.
